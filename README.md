# Countdown Timer

A simple and flexible **Python Countdown Timer** that allows the user to enter hours, minutes, and seconds, then counts down the time in **hh:mm:ss** format. The timer updates every second and notifies the user when the time is up.

## Features

- Allows user to input hours, minutes, and seconds separately.
- Displays time in **hh:mm:ss** format.
- Flexible input: you can choose to only input hours, minutes, or seconds based on your needs.
- Counts down one second at a time and prints the updated time in real-time.
- When the timer reaches zero, the program will display "Time's up! ðŸš¨".

The program will then calculate the total time (2 hours and 45 seconds) and begin the countdown:
02:00:45 02:00:44 02:00:43 ... Time's up! ðŸš¨

## Code Explanation

- **`countdown_timer()`**: This function takes the total time in seconds and counts down. It uses `divmod()` to convert total seconds into hours, minutes, and seconds, and then formats the countdown in **hh:mm:ss** format. The timer updates every second using `time.sleep(1)`.
  
- **`main()`**: This function asks the user what units of time they want to input (hours, minutes, and/or seconds). It then calls `countdown_timer()` with the calculated total seconds.
  
## Requirements

- Python 3.x
